## First Section

I got ✨a lot✨ of positive feedback from my <a class="cursor-pointer no-underline border border-transparent hover:border-b-purple-500 transition-all duration-300">Guide to creating animations that spark joy with Framer Motion</a>, and it's undeniable that this library has piqued many developers' interests in the world of web-based animations.

While I introduced in this previous post many of the foundational pieces that compose an animation, and how one can orchestrate multiple transitions very easily with Framer Motion, I did not touch upon many of the more advanced features that this library provides.

Ever wondered how to propagate animations throughout several components or to orchestrate complex layout transitions? Well, this article will tell you all about these advanced patterns and show you some of the great things one can accomplish with Framer Motion! :smile:

## Propagation

One of the first advanced patterns I got to encounter when I tried to add some micro-interactions with Framer Motion on my projects is **propagation**. I quickly learned that it's possible to propagate **changes of variants** from a **parent motion component to any child motion component**. However, this got me confused at the beginning because it broke some of the mental models I originally had when it comes to defining animations.

Remember in <a class="cursor-pointer no-underline border border-transparent hover:border-b-purple-500 transition-all duration-300" href="/blog/first-blog">my previous blog post</a> when we learned that every Framer Motion Animation needed 3 properties (props) `initial`, `animate`, `transition`, to define a transition/animation? Well, for this pattern **that's not entirely true**.

Framer Motion allows variants to "flow down" through **every motion child component** as long as these motion components do not have an `animate` prop defined. **Only the parent motion component**, in this case, **defines the** `animate` **prop**. The children themselves only define the behavior they intent to have for those variants.

A great example where I used propagation on this blog is the "Featured" section on the home page of this blog. When you hover it, the individual cards "glow" and this effect is made possible by this pattern. To explain what really is happening under the hood, I built this little widget below where I reproduced this effect:

## Mauris velit laoreet vitae cursus augue

- Massa egestas consequat nisl id volutpat, varius neque aenean.

- Venenatis tincidunt eros pretium viverra lacinia convallis, turpis orci condimentum fusce.

- Pellentesque in aliquet nisi gravida netus, commodo aptent volutpat.

- Nisi rutrum eros euismod, parturient ullamcorper mattis a, dapibus vestibulum.

You can see that hovering (or tapping if you're on mobile) the card or even the label above it triggers the glow effect. What kind of sorcery is this?! By clicking on the "perspective" button, you can see what happens under the hood:

1. There's an "invisible" motion layer covering the card and the label. This layer holds the `whileHover` prop which sets the variant "hover".
2. The "glow" itself is a motion component as well, however, the only thing it defines is its own `variants` object with a `hover` key.

Thus when hovering this invisible layer, we toggle the "hover" variant and any child motion component having this variant define in their `variants` prop will detect this change and toggle the corresponding behavior.
